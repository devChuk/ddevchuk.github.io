In many supermarket chains in New York City, overcrowding is a huge issue. It's actually normal to see lines circle and snake in the aisle of a supermarket and sometimes the lines reach out the doors.

So my team and I came up with Kangaroo. It's an app that improves the supermarket with a new kind of self-checkout.

The app starts by figuring out which store you're in through your GPS location. Once that's done, you can start shopping. When you put an item into a shopping cart, you can scan its barcode to put it into the "virtual" shopping cart. This way when you check out, you just press a button in Kangaroo to pay for everything in your cart. No more waiting in lines and slow self-checkout machines.
