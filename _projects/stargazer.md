While working on this personal website, I wanted to create a home page background that matched the site's design. My [old website](http://www.brianch.uk/devchukV2/) had an animated one, so I wanted a new one to see how I've grown as a programmer since then. I also wanted to experiment with creating experiences in WebGL.

The [finished product](http://www.brianch.uk) turned out to be a lot like I originally saw in my mind, but not without overcoming some obstacles.

As I was looking for a concept, my friends and I drove to Lake Tahoe to go stargazing. As a native New Yorker, I was completely surprised. I had never seen that many stars before and the idea for a homage to stargazing became clear. After several sketches and plans in my notebook, I was ready to start coding.

When coding creative projects, constant reiteration is required to build experiences that look and feel great. I like to have a "playground" section of code to hack together ideas with complete disregard for strict coding practices. This way, I can quickly get ideas out into the environment and iterate on behavior and motion design. Once things look good, I can rewrite the section into production code. This has the additional benefit of already knowing how to structure my code, and saves a bit of refactoring later on.

The animation is divided into three main phases:
1. A rotating globe
2. A starfield, a set of slow-moving points that form connections with nearby neighbors
3. A deer constellation formed out of the stars

All of the objects in the phases are composed of invisible nodes and visible connections. I keep track of the phases with a global `_stage` object. Note how a `TRANSITION` property is added. This stage is used in between the other stages to determine how to move the nodes to a new stage.

{% highlight javascript %}
var STAGE = {
    TRANSITION: 0,
    SPHERE: 1,
    STARFIELD: 2,
    STAG: 3
};
var _stage = STAGE.SPHERE;

// ...

var render = function () {
    renderID = window.requestAnimationFrame( render );
    if (window.innerWidth <= 991) {
        cancelAnimationFrame(renderID);
    }
    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    switch(_stage) {
        case STAGE.TRANSITION:
            renderTransitions(ctx);
            break;

        case STAGE.SPHERE:
            renderSphere(ctx);
            break;

        case STAGE.STARFIELD:
            renderStarfield(ctx)
            break;

        case STAGE.STAG:
            renderStag(ctx);
            break;
    }

    var timeElapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
    if (timeElapsed > 8000 && _stage == STAGE.SPHERE)
        startTransition(STAGE.STARFIELD);
    else if (timeElapsed > 18000 && _stage == STAGE.STARFIELD)
        startTransition(STAGE.STAG);
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
};
{% endhighlight %}

I worked on each stage chronologically.

# Sphere

![](/res/img/projects/stag-sphere.png)

The nodes that make up the sphere actually live in 2D space, but I had to use a 3D object to control the motions of the nodes.

{% highlight javascript %}
sphereM = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.SphereGeometry(300, 15, 15));

function renderSphere (ctx) {
    vertices = [];
    genProjectedVertices(sphereM, vertices);
    drawConnections(closeEnough, ctx);
    sphereM.rotation.x = mouseY;
    sphereM.rotation.y = mouseX;

    sphereM.rotation.x += sphereX;
    sphereM.rotation.y += sphereY;

    sphereX += 0.001;
    sphereY += 0.001;    
    sphereM.rotation.z += 0.001;

}
{% endhighlight %}

I use three.js to generate a 3D sphere mesh, and then I project the vertices of the mesh into a 2D plane. Then I draw connections between all vertices within a certain distance of each other. The closer two vertices are, the brighter the line between them.

{% highlight javascript %}
function genProjectedVertices (model, projectedVertices) {
    model.updateMatrixWorld();
    for (var i = 0; i < model.geometry.vertices.length; i++) {
        var b = model.geometry.vertices[i].clone();
        b.applyMatrix4(model.matrixWorld);
        b = projectToScreen(b);
        delete b.z;
        projectedVertices.push(b);
    }
}

function drawConnections (distanceThreshold, ctx) {
    for (var i = 0; i < vertices.length; i++) {
        for (var j = i + 1; j < vertices.length; j++) {
            var dist = distanceBetweenDimTwo(vertices[i], vertices[j]);
            if (dist < distanceThreshold) {
                ctx.strokeStyle = '#ffffff';
                ctx.globalAlpha = map_range(dist, 0, distanceThreshold, 0.5, 0);
                drawLine(vertices[i], vertices[j], ctx);
            }
        }
    }
}

function projectToScreen (threeDimPoint) {
    var point = threeDimPoint.clone();
    var winWidthHalf = (document.documentElement.clientWidth/2);
    var winHeightHalf = (document.documentElement.clientHeight/2);
    point.project(camera);
    point.x = ( point.x * winWidthHalf ) + winWidthHalf;
    point.y = - ( point.y * winHeightHalf ) + winHeightHalf;
    point.z = 0;
    return point;
};

function map_range (value, low1, high1, low2, high2) {
    return (low2 + (high2 - low2) * (value - low1) / (high1 - low1));
}

function distanceBetweenDimTwo (p1, p2) {
    return sqrt(p(p1.x - p2.x) + p(p1.y - p2.y));
}

{% endhighlight %}

# Starfield

![](/res/img/projects/stag-stars.png)

The code here is simpler, where I just move a set of nodes randomly. If a single node reaches the edge of the screen, it turns back in the other direction. The behavior for drawing connections is the same as the sphere's behavior.

{% highlight javascript %}
var numStars = (canvas.width * canvas.height > 550000) ? 500 : 256;

for (var i = 0; i < numStars; i++) {
    starFieldM.push({
        x: (Math.random() * canvas.width),
        y: (Math.random() * canvas.height)
    });
    starVelocities.push({
        dx: (Math.random() * 0.4 - 0.2),
        dy: (Math.random() * 0.4 - 0.2)
    });
}

function renderStarfield (ctx) {
    vertices = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < starFieldM.length; i++) {
        starFieldM[i].x += starVelocities[i].dx;
        starFieldM[i].y += starVelocities[i].dy;
        if (starFieldM[i].x < 0 || starFieldM[i].x > canvas.width)
            starVelocities[i].dx *= -1;
        if (starFieldM[i].y < 0 || starFieldM[i].y > canvas.height)
            starVelocities[i].dy *= -1;
        vertices.push(starFieldM[i]);
    }
    drawConnections(closeEnough, ctx);
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Transitioning

To transition between stages, we look at the next stage's vertices to generate a set of `_goalPoints`. Then, each current node we have is assigned to one point of the `_goalPoints` and begins to move to its goal point.

I made the movement of the nodes feel more natural by following Google's Material Motion Design Handbook. When the nodes start moving, they start from a slow speed and accelerate. When the nodes stop, they decelarate to a stop.

Once all of the nodes have reached their respective goal points, then the transition ends and we set `_stage` to the next stage.

# Deer

![](/res/img/projects/stag-complete.png)

Drawing the deer out of nodes was the most complicated part. I modeled the general parts of the deer in Blender, and exported it into a JSON format for three.js to import.

When I had the vertices for the deer, I set the outside boundary points as the goal points for the transition. Then, I generated several uniformly random points inside the deer.

But how does one get a random point inside an irregular polygon? I used three steps:
1. Generate an array of triangles that cover the same area as the deer. I found an open source polygon triangulation library called [Earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut)
2. Randomly select which triangle to use, weighted by its area. For instance if triangle A is 75% of the area and triangle B is 25% of the area, triangle A should be picked 75% of the time and B should be 25%. The snippet below does this
3. Select a random point within that triangle

{% highlight javascript %}
function genRandPtFromTriangles (array, triObj, upperRandBound) {
    var x;
    if (upperRandBound) {
        x = Math.random() * upperRandBound;
    } else {
        x = Math.random();
    }

    var index = -1;
    // if upperRandBound isn't set, x is a random float between 0 and 1.
    // triObj.aR consists of the area ratio of the triangle area : parent polygon area
    // for example, if a triangle had 50% of the area it would be 0.5
    // loop though ðŸ”ºs and subtract area ratios from x until negative
    while (x >= 0 && index <= triObj.aR.length - 1) {
        x -= triObj.aR[++index];
    }

    var a = triObj.v[triObj.i[index][0]];
    var b = triObj.v[triObj.i[index][1]];
    var c = triObj.v[triObj.i[index][2]];
    // gen rand pt in triangle

    // from https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/18686/uniform-random-point-in-triangle
    var r1 = Math.random(), r2 = Math.random();
    a = pointAdd(scalarPtMultiply(1 - sqrt(r1), a),
                 scalarPtMultiply(sqrt(r1) * (1 - r2), b));
    array.push(pointAdd(scalarPtMultiply(sqrt(r1) * r2, c),
                        a));
}
{% endhighlight %}

After that, I added more random points to bring out the head and ears of the deer. The eye was completely filled in, and I manually drew out a few lines in Blender for the snout.
