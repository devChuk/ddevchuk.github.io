This project page is a work in progress. I'll finish my description of it by Sunday.

<!--
    Write a proper description
    Grab a thumbnail
    Grab a gif of the animation
    Pics:

    sphere
    starfield
    stag
        stag trianglification. how do you select a random point in an irregular shape?

    There's a lot to say here.



    I wasn't sure if I would consider something this small to be a project but it is. 1000 lines of Javascript. My friends and I went on a trip to Lake Tahoe to go stargazing. It
    was my first time ever. It was increbielblahblahblha

    I was remaking my website and wanted a new background animation. It felt right because the old one had one, but I wanted to have a better one and also have a challenge. So that's what I did.

    Stargazer has three modes. SPHERE, STARFIELD, AND STAG.
    It's supposed to represent the process of looking at constellations from the Earth to the sky. The Stag is your constellation.
    I chose a deer because it had an elegance to it. Kinda always fond of them because I never saw them as a city kid.

    Similar to how game loops worked. Setup. Render
    3 stages had their own render and update functions and variables
    we'll go through each of the three stages.
    To transition, we had a transition function that would set goalPoints.

    Responsiveness.
