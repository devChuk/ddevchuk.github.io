You can play it [here](http://brianch.uk/snake).

The game itself is responsive&mdash;it works on all browser window sizes and mobile phones. It even resizes itself on the fly if you resize the window while you play the game. You can use arrow keys, or tap the sides of the screen to control the snake on mobile.
