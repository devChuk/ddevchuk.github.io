                        <p>
                            My name is Brian Chuk. I'm a New York native, StuyCS alumnus, and hackNY 2015 Fellow. I graduated last December from New York University where I studied Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am primarily a full-stack developer with some experience in Android and hardware programming. I started teaching myself how to code by building drones and robots from complete scratch in high school. Since then, I've worked on several projects in C++, Javascript, Python, Java, Go, and Ruby.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my last internship at Flatiron Health, I did a solo project where I built an internal tool where users would be able to view database schema, add metadata to them, and view relations between data tables via their foreign keys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before that, I took a gap year off school to travel around Asia and work as a remote freelance developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my 2017 internship at B12, I designed & developed a version history system for a customer-facing website builder. It would save all changes to all websites every 10 minutes, and enable customers to revert to a previous version of their website at any point of time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using computational geometry and computer vision, I implemented new product features for Shaper as a software intern. I've worked for Syncano as a developer evangelist, and for Betterpath as a software intern. In Betterpath, I developed new pages in React and created an automated integration web tester in Selenium &amp; Ruby.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am a hackathon veteran&mdash;you might see me on a weekend mentoring other hackers or giving talks/workshops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy a good cup of matcha, bouldering, reading, skateboarding, &amp; woodworking. On warm nights, I like to head out to play on this dusty, old, outdoor pool table right by the Hudson River.
                        </p>
