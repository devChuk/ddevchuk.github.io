Still working on this website be patient pls

*I wrote this post on my [old website](http://www.brianch.uk/devchukV1/blog/2014/09/14/mhacks/) one year ago in the beginning of my freshman year. I still find the general idea of this true.*

I haven't really thought about the use of this blog ever since I programmed it. It was more of an excuse to learn how to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to be honest. But now, it seems to be a good idea to have a semi-private place on the web where I can put my thoughts in and maybe revisit after some time later.
